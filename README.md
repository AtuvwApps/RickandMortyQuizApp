# RickandMortyQuizApp
This is a quiz game I made in Android Studio for fans of the TV show Rick and Morty. 
The game concept is simple, each question the user is presented with a picture and four possible answers. The questions get more obscure and challenging as the game goes on. The player has 3 lives and loses a life with each incorrect answer. The game ends when the player loses all of their lives or if they answer 100 correct (In which case they will have a chance to upload their name and picture to “The 100 Club” to show off for other players).
The questions are stored using Firestore Database and the pictures for each question are retrieved from rickandmortyapi.com
Firebase storage is used to hold the pictures for members of the 100 club.
I also included banner and interstitial ads from Admob (ad ID’s etc were removed for posting here)
